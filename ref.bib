abstract = {A global tectonic regionalization, GTR1, has been constructed for use in seismological studies of aspherical heterogeneity. Three oceanic regions are defined by equal increments in the square root of crustal age (25- and 100-m.y. isochrons), and three continental regions are distinguished according to their generalized tectonic behavior during the Phanerozoic (Precambrian shields and platforms, Phanerozoic platforms, Phanerozoic orogenic zones and magmatic belts). The regionalization is presented both as a tectonic map and by its discretization on a 5degrees by 5degrees geographic grid. GTR1 is reasonably successful in accounting for the large-scale geographic variations in body-wave, surface-wave, and free-oscillation data, and it should prove useful in the seismological testing of the competing theories of tectospheric development.},

abstract = {We present a refined map of geothermal heat flow for Antarctica, Aq1, based on multiple observables. The map is generated using a similarity detection approach by attributing observables from geophysics and geology to a large number of high-quality heat flow values (N = 5,792) from other continents. Observables from global, continental, and regional datasets for Antarctica are used with a weighting function that allows the degree of similarity to increase with proximity and how similar the observables are. The similarity detection parameters are optimized through cross correlation. For each grid cell in Antarctica, a weighted average heat flow value and uncertainty metrics are calculated. The Aq1 model provides higher spatial resolution in comparison to previous results. High heat flow is shown in the Thwaites Glacier region, with local values over 150 mW m−2. We also map elevated values over 80 mW m−2 in Palmer Land, Marie Byrd Land, Victoria Land and Queen Mary Land. Very low heat flow is shown in the interior of Wilkes Land and Coats Land, with values under 40 mW m−2. We anticipate that the new geothermal heat flow map, Aq1, and its uncertainty bounds will find extended use in providing boundary conditions for ice sheet modeling and understanding the interactions between the cryosphere and solid Earth. The computational framework and open architecture allow for the model to be reproduced, adapted and updated with additional data, or model subsets to be output at higher resolution for regional studies.},
